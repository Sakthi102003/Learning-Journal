# Day 3 – Python Basics (Part 3) 🐍

## ➕ Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are symbols used to perform mathematical operations.

### Key Terms
- **Operator** – A special symbol that performs an operation  
- **Operand** – A value or variable on which the operation is performed  

---

### 🔢 Types of Arithmetic Operations

#### 1. Addition (`+`)
- **Unary plus** – Applied to a single operand  
- **Addition operator** – Adds two operands  

#### 2. Subtraction (`-`)
- **Unary minus** – Applied to a single operand  
- **Subtraction operator** – Subtracts one operand from another  

#### 3. Multiplication (`*`)
- Binary operator  
- Multiplies two operands  

#### 4. Division (`/`)
- Binary operator  
- Divides the first operand by the second  
- Always returns a **float** value  

#### 5. Floor Division (`//`)
- Binary operator  
- Performs division but returns the **integer part** of the result  

#### 6. Modulus (`%`)
- Binary operator  
- Returns the **remainder** of the division  

#### 7. Power (`**`)
- Binary operator  
- Raises the first operand to the power of the second

## 🔍 Relational / Comparison Operators
Relational operators compare two operands and return a **Boolean value** (`True` or `False`).

### List of Relational Operators

- **Greater than (`>`)**  
  Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than the right operand  

- **Less than (`<`)**  
  Returns `True` if the left operand is less than the right operand  

- **Equal to (`==`)**  
  Returns `True` if both operands are equal  

- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**  
  Returns `True` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand  

- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**  
  Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand  

- **Not equal to (`!=`)**  
  Returns `True` if both operands are not equal  

---

## 🔗 Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditional expressions.

### List of Logical Operators

#### 1. Logical AND (`and`)
- Returns `True` if **both** conditions are `True`  
- Otherwise returns `False`  

#### 2. Logical OR (`or`)
- Returns `True` if **at least one** condition is `True`  
- Otherwise returns `False`  

#### 3. Logical NOT (`not`)
- Reverses the result of a condition  
- `True` becomes `False` and vice versa

### 🧠 Operator Types Summary
- **Binary operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`, `and`, `or`
- **Unary operators**: `+`, `-`, `not`
