# Day 2 – Python Basics (Part 2) 🐍

## 🔁 Type Casting
**Type casting** is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.

In Python, user input is always taken as a **string**, so type casting is required when performing mathematical operations.

### Common Type Casting Functions:
- `int()` – converts to integer
- `float()` – converts to decimal number
- `str()` – converts to string
- `bool()` – converts to boolean

## ⌨️ input() Function
The `input()` function is used to take input from the user.

- It prompts the user to enter data
- The returned value is always of type **string**
- Type casting is needed if numeric operations are required

---

## 🧪 Practice
Practiced programs related to:
- User input handling
- Type casting user input into required data types
- Simple interactive programs
