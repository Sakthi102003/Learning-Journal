## 🚀 Where is Python Used?
Python is commonly used in:

1. Web Development  
2. Software Development  
3. Mathematics & Scientific Computing  
4. System Scripting & Automation  

---

## ⚙️ What Can Python Do?
Python is powerful and flexible. It can:

- Be used on the **server side** to build web applications  
- Work alongside other software to **automate workflows**  
- **Connect to databases**, read data, and modify records  
- **Handle large amounts of data** and perform complex mathematical operations  
- Be used for **rapid prototyping** and full-scale software development  

---

## 🤔 Why Python?
Python is popular because:

- Its syntax is **close to English**, making it easy to learn  
- Developers can write **fewer lines of code** compared to other languages  
- It is an **interpreted language**, so code executes immediately  

---

## 🧬 Python Versions
- The most widely used version today is **Python 3**
- Python 2 is deprecated and should not be used

---

## 📝 Comments in Python
Comments are used to:
- Explain code for **yourself**
- Help **other developers** understand the program

Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter during execution.

---

## 📦 Variables
A **variable** is a container used to store data values.

A variable behaves as if it were the value it contains.

### Common Data Types:

## 🧵 f-Strings (Formatted String Literals)
f-Strings allow easy string formatting in Python.

- Python expressions can be written inside `{ }`
- Can reference **variables or literal values**
- Makes output cleaner and more readable
