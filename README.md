# 🛡️ Cybersecurity & 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **structured, day-by-day learning journey** focused on building **strong cybersecurity foundations** alongside **Python skills for security automation**.

This repository is not about certificates or speed‑running tutorials.
It documents **real learning, hands-on practice, mistakes, fixes, and clarity gained day by day**.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

* To build **rock-solid fundamentals** in cybersecurity
* To learn Python **as a practical security tool**, not just a programming language
* To document learning in a **clear, revisable, and professional way**
* To create proof of consistency, discipline, and understanding

> ⚠️ This is a *learning-first* repository. Notes are written in my own words after study and practice.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

* **Foundations first** → tools later
* **Understand → practice → document**
* No blind copy-paste
* No rushing topics
* Clarity over complexity

Cybersecurity rewards **patience and precision**, not shortcuts.

Each day:

* Focuses on **one core concept**
* Has its own folder
* Contains a `README.md` with:

  * Concepts learned
  * Corrections & clarifications
  * Commands & examples
  * Key takeaways

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Foundations

* Networking fundamentals
* TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS
* Linux basics (CLI)
* Security principles (CIA triad, threats, risks)

### Phase 2: Practical Security

* Web security fundamentals
* OWASP Top 10
* System exploitation basics
* Log analysis & detection concepts

### Phase 3: Integration

* Attack → detect → analyze → fix
* End-to-end understanding of security incidents

---

## 🐍 Python in This Journey

Python is used as a **supporting weapon**, not the main goal.

### Python is applied for:

* Port scanning
* Log analysis
* Password strength checking
* Automation scripts
* Security tooling basics

Focus is on:

* Readability
* Security mindset
* Practical use cases

---

## 🧪 How Each Day Works

1. Study concepts from trusted resources
2. Perform hands-on practice (commands, labs, scripts)
3. Write raw notes
4. Refine into a clean `README.md`
5. Commit progress

Consistency > intensity.
